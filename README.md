[![pre-commit](https://github.com/cristiklein/work-dashboard/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cristiklein/work-dashboard/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yml)

## Overview

The **Work Dashboard** is a Chrome extension that helps you stay on top of your workday by providing you a **single pane of glass** for what you need to do.
It's local-first and displays:

- Google Calendar
- Google Tasks
- Jira Issues assigned to you
- Confluence Tasks assigned to you
- GitHub Issues assigned to you
- GitHub PRs assigned to you
- GitHub Review Requests for you

> [!NOTE]
> Sadly, the [Google Drive API v3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65516503/find-files-with-comments-with-google-drive-api-v3) does allow for searching all files with comments assigned to you in a practical way.

## Setup

### Step 1: Authentication Tokens

For this extension to work, you'll need to authenticate using for the different services (Google, Jira, and Confluence).

- **Google Calendar and Tasks**: The extension will perform authentication with Google (via OAuth) to access your Google Calendar events and tasks.
- **Jira**: Youâ€™ll need to create a [Jira Personal Access Token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html).
- **Confluence**: You'll need to create a [Confluence Personal Access Token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html).
- **GitHub**: You'll need to create a [GitHub Personal Access Token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

You can configure the Jira, Confluence and GitHub tokens in the Configuration section of Work Dashboard.
